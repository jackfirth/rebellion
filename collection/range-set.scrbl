@title{Range Sets}
@defmodule[rebellion/collection/range-set]


A @deftech{range set} is a sorted @tech{collection} of nonempty, disconnected @tech{ranges}. All
ranges in the same range set must use the same @tech{comparator}. Two immutable range sets are
@racket[equal?] if they contain the same ranges. Two mutable range sets are @racket[equal?] if they
will @emph{always} contain the same ranges, meaning that they share the same mutable state. This is
not necessarily the same as being @racket[eq?], as some range sets may be views of others.

All range sets are @tech/reference{sequences}. When iterated, a range set traverses its ranges in
ascending order as defined by the comparator shared by those ranges. To traverse a range set in
descending order, use @racket[in-range-set] with @racket[#:descending?] set to true.


@defproc[(range-set? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
 A predicate for @tech{range sets}. Includes mutable, immutable, and @tech{unmodifiable} range sets.}


@defproc[(immutable-range-set? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

@defproc[(mutable-range-set? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
 A predicate for mutable @tech{range sets}. Implies @racket[range-set?].}

 Constructs an immutable @tech{range set} containing the given @racket[range]s. If at least one
 @racket[range] is provided, @racket[comparator] may be omitted and defaults to the comparator of the
 first range. Overlapping ranges are disallowed, but adjacent ranges are accepted and are merged
 together. All ranges must use @racket[comparator] as their endpoint comparators or a contract
 exception is raised.

 the returned complement set removes that range from the underlying set, and vice-versa for removing
 ranges from the complement set.
