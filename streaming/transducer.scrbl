@title{Transducers}
@defmodule[rebellion/streaming/transducer]

A @deftech{transducer} is an object that can incrementally transform one
(potentially infinite) sequence of elements into another sequence. Transducers
are state machines; performing a transduction involves @emph{starting} the
transducer to get an initial state, then repeatedly updating that state by
either @emph{consuming} an element from the input sequence or by @emph{emitting}
an element to the output sequence. When the input sequence is exhausted, the
transducer enters a @emph{half closed} state where it may emit more output
elements but it will never consume more input elements. When the transducer
stops emitting elements, its @emph{finisher} is called to clean up any resources
held in the final transduction state. Optionally, a transducer may half close
early, before the input sequence is fully consumed.

@defproc[(transducer? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
 A predicate for @tech{transducers}.}

@defproc[(transduce [seq sequence?]
                    [trans transducer?] ...
                    [#:into red reducer?])
         any/c]{
 Executes a @deftech{transduction pipeline}, alternatively called a
 @deftech{stream pipeline}, which transforms the source @racket[seq] with a
 series of intermediate operations --- represented by the @racket[trans]
 arguments --- then reduces the transformed sequence with @racket[red].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 20)
              (filtering even?)
              (mapping number->immutable-string)
              #:into (join-into-string ", ")))}

@defproc[(in-transduced [seq sequence?] [trans transducer?]) sequence?]{
 Lazily transduces @racket[seq] with @racket[trans], returning a
 @tech/reference{sequence} that, when iterated, passes the elements of @racket[
 seq] to @racket[trans] as inputs and uses the emitted outputs of @racket[trans]
 as the wrapper sequence's elements.}

@defproc[(into-transduced [trans transducer?] ... [#:into red reducer?])
         reducer?]{
 Combines @racket[red] with each @racket[trans], returning a new @tech{reducer}
 that, when reducing a @tech/reference{sequence}, first passes the elements
 through the given chain of @tech{transducers}. The outputs of the last @racket[
 trans] are sent to @racket[red] as inputs.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (eval:no-prompt
    (define into-first-ten-letters
      (into-transduced (filtering char-alphabetic?)

@section{Element-Transforming Transducers}

@defproc[(mapping [f (-> any/c any/c)]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that applies @racket[f] to input elements and
 emits the returned result downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (mapping (Î» (x) (* x x)))
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(append-mapping [f (-> any/c sequence?)]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that applies @racket[f] to input elements and
 emits @italic{each} element in the returned sequence downstream.
 
 This is similar to Java's
 @hyperlink["https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#flatMap-java.util.function.Function-"]{@tt{Stream.flatMap}}
 method.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (set 'red 'green 'blue)
              (append-mapping symbol->immutable-string)
              #:into into-string))
   (transduce (list 3 1 2)
              (append-mapping (lambda (n) (in-range 0 n))
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(folding [f (-> any/c any/c any/c)] [init any/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that folds over the input elements and emits the
 current fold state after each element. Specifically, the transducer starts with
 @racket[init] as its state and, for each input element, applies @racket[f] to
 its current state and the input element returning the next state, which is also
 sent downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (folding + 0)
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(batching [batch-reducer reducer?]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that collects elements of the transduced
 sequence into batches using @racket[batch-reducer]. Elements are fed into
 @racket[batch-reducer] until it terminates the reduction, then the reduction
 result is emitted downstream. If there are more elements remaining, then the
 @racket[batch-reducer] is restarted to prepare the next batch. When the
 transduced sequence has no more elements, if the last batch is only partially
 complete, then the @racket[batch-reducer]'s finisher is called to produce the
 last batch.

 If @racket[batch-reducer] refuses to consume any elements and immediately
 terminates the reduction every time it's started, then the returned transducer
 raises @racket[exn:fail:contract].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 10)
              (batching (reducer-limit into-list 4))
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(windowing [window-size exact-positive-integer?]
                    [#:into window-reducer reducer? into-list])
         transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that groups the elements of the transduced
 sequence into sliding windows of size @racket[window-size]. Each window
 contains @racket[window-size] elements that were adjacent in the original
 sequence, and the window "slides" one element to the right at a time.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list 1 2 3 4 5)
              (windowing 3)
              #:into into-list))

 If @racket[window-reducer] is provided, it is used to reduce each window. By
 default each window's elements are collected into a list. Only full windows are
 reduced and emitted downstream: if @racket[window-reducer] finishes early for a
 window, before consuming @racket[window-size] elements, the reduction result is
 not emitted downstream until after enough elements are consumed from the
 transduced sequence to verify that the result corresponds to a full window.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world"
              (windowing 3 #:into into-string)
              #:into into-list)
   (transduce "hello world"
              (windowing 3 #:into (into-index-of #\w))
              #:into into-list))}

@defthing[enumerating (transducer/c any/c enumerated?)]{
 A transducer that emits each element along with its position in the sequence,
 as an @racket[enumerated?] value.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "cat" enumerating #:into into-list))}

@deftogether[[

 @defproc[(enumerated-position [enum enumerated?]) natural?]]]{
 Predicate, constructor, and accessors for the enumerated values emitted by the
 @racket[enumerating] transducer.}

@section{Element-Removing Transducers}

@defproc[(filtering [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that passes input elements downstream only when
 they satisfy @racket[pred].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (filtering even?)
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(taking [amount natural?]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that limits the upstream sequence to its first
 @racket[amount] elements. There is no buffering; each element is consumed and
 emitted downstream before the next one is consumed.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world"
              (taking 5)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(taking-while [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that terminates the upstream sequence as soon as
 @racket[pred] returns false for an element. Each element for which @racket[
 pred] returns true is passed downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "The quick brown fox"
              (taking-while char-alphabetic?)
              #:into into-string))}

 @defproc[
 (taking-minima

 transducer?]]]{
 Constructs @tech{transducers} that remove all elements from the sequence except
 for the largest elements (called the @emph{maxima}) or the smallest elements
 (called the @emph{minima}), respectively. If multiple values are tied for
 largest or smallest, all of them are kept. The relative order of the maxima or
 minima is preserved.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list 2 512 3 5 512)
              (taking-maxima)
              #:into into-list))

 Elements are compared using @racket[comparator]. If @racket[key-function] is
 provided, then elements are not compared directly. Instead, a @emph{key} is
 extracted from each element using @racket[key-function] and the keys of
 elements are compared instead of the elements themselves.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list "cat" "dog" "zebra" "horse")
              (taking-maxima string<=>)

 Constructs @tech{transducers} that remove all elements from the sequence except for the elements that
 are larger than their neighbors (called the @emph{local maxima}) or smaller than their neighbors
 (called the @emph{local minima}), respectively. If a subsequence of values are equivalent but larger
 (or smaller) than the subsequence's neighbors, the last element of the subsequence is kept. The
 relative order of the local maxima or minima is preserved.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list 1 8 4 7 1)
              (taking-local-maxima)

 Elements are compared using @racket[comparator]. If @racket[key-function] is
 provided, then elements are not compared directly. Instead, a @emph{key} is
 extracted from each element using @racket[key-function] and the keys of
 elements are compared instead of the elements themselves.

@defproc[(taking-duplicates [#:key key-function (-> any/c any/c) values]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that keeps only the duplicate elements of the transduced sequence.
 The first time an element occurs, it is removed from the sequence. Subsequent occurrences of that
 element are emitted downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world" (taking-duplicates) #:into into-string))

 If @racket[key-function] is provided, then it is used to extract a key from each element and only
 elements with duplicate keys are emitted downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list "red" "yellow" "blue" "purple" "green")
              (taking-duplicates #:key string-length)
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(dropping [amount natural?]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes the first @racket[amount] elements
 from the transduced sequence, then passes all remaining elements downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world"
              (dropping 5)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(dropping-while [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes elements from the transduced
 sequence until @racket[pred] returns false for an element, then passes all
 remaining elements downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "The quick brown fox"
              (dropping-while char-alphabetic?)

@defproc[(deduplicating [#:key key-function (-> any/c any/c) values])
         transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes duplicate elements from the
 transduced sequence. The relative order of unique elements is preserved.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "Hello world!" (deduplicating) #:into into-string))

 If @racket[key-function] is provided, is is applied to each element and
 uniqueness is based on the returned key value.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list "cat" "dog" "CAT" "HORSE" "horse")

@defproc[(deduplicating-consecutive
          [#:key key-function (-> any/c any/c) values])
         transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes @emph{consecutive} duplicate
 elements from the transduced sequence. The relative order of retained elements
 is preserved. If the input sequence is sorted, or if it merely has all
 duplicates grouped together, then the constructed transducer behaves
 equivalently to @racket[deduplicating] except it consumes a constant amount of
 memory.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "Mississippi" (deduplicating-consecutive) #:into into-string))

 If @racket[key-function] is provided, it is applied to each element and
 uniqueness is based on the returned key value.

         transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that sorts elements in ascending order according
 to @racket[comparator]. The sort is @emph{stable}; the relative order of
 equivalent elements is preserved. If @racket[descending?] is true, the elements
 are sorted in descending order instead of ascending order.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list 4 1 2 5 3)

 If @racket[key-function] is provided, it is applied to each element and the
 result is tested with @racket[comparator] rather than the element itself.

@defproc[(transducer-pipe [trans transducer?] ...) transducer?]{
 Composes each @racket[trans] into the next, returning a single @tech{

 Like @racket[transducer-pipe], but in right-to-left order instead of

 @racket[compose1] functions, but right-to-left ordered composition is not
 recommended. Left-to-right composition with @racket[transducer-pipe] should be
 preferred instead as it is far more readable and aligns with the order in which
 transducers are given to @racket[transduce].

 @tech/reference{impersonator properties} in @racket[properties] are attached to
 the returned impersonator.

 If @racket[chaperone?] is true, then the returned impersonator is a
 @tech/reference{chaperone}. In that case, both @racket[domain-guard] and
 @racket[range-guard] must always return values equal to whatever they're given.
 Additionally, if a returned value is an impersonator, it must also be a
 chaperone.

@section{Debugging Transducers}

@defproc[(peeking [handler (-> any/c void?)]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that calls @racket[handler] on each element for
 its side effects. Elements are emitted immediately after @racket[handler] is
 called on them, so if an element is never consumed downstream then @racket[
 handler] won't be called on any later elements.

 This function is intended mostly for debugging, as @racket[(peeking displayln)]
 can be inserted into a transduction pipeline to investigate what elements are
 consumed in that part of the pipeline.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (list 1 2 3 'apple 4 5 6)
              (peeking displayln)
              (taking-while number?)
              #:into into-sum))}

@section{Testing Transducers}
@defmodule[rebellion/streaming/transducer/testing]

This module provides utilities for testing @tech{transducers}.

@defproc[(observing-transduction-events [subject transducer?])
         (transducer/c any/c transduction-event?)]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that passes consumed values to @racket[subject],
 then emits @racket[transduction-event?] structures describing the state
 transitions that @racket[subject] performs, including any consumed or emitted
 values. This is mostly useful when testing transducers, as the emitted events
 can be gathered into a list and asserted against.

 The first emitted event is always @racket[start-event] and the last one is
 always @racket[finish-event]. A @racket[half-close-event] is emitted if
 @racket[subject] was half-closed, which means the upstream sequence ran out of
 elements while @racket[subject] was trying to consume one.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-naturals)
              (observing-transduction-events (taking 3))
              #:into into-list)
   (eval:no-prompt)
   (transduce (list 1 2)
              (observing-transduction-events (taking 3))
              #:into into-list))}
