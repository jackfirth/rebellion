;; Immutable persistent red-black trees (Okasaki's implementation)


;; We use constants for the red/black color enum instead of define-enum-type to avoid unnecessary
;; dependencies on other parts of Rebellion, especially cyclic dependencies. We define constants
;; instead of using the symbols directly so that typos are compile-time errors.
(define red 'red)

;; To implement deletion, we allow the tree to temporarily contain "double black" nodes and leaves
;; while rebalancing the tree after removing an element. This approach is based on the one outlined in
;; the "Deletion: The curse of the red-black tree" Functional Pearl paper. Link below:
