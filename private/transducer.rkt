;; Implementation of in-transduced
;;
;; The in-transduced function is the point of intergration between the
;; transducer API and racket's sequence API. It wraps a sequence with a
;; transducer and returns a new sequence that lazily transduces the original.
;;
;; Background
;;
;; The sequence API (as defined by make-do-sequence) uses a "position" to
;; represent the current state of the sequence iterator, but due to the way the
;; early-next-pos function is called a sequence can alternate between two
;; different state types. Let those types be called P and Q. Then the following
;; statements describe which sequence functions produce and consume which state
;; types. The function statements are listed in order of when they're called for
;; each output element of the sequence (i.e. the pos->element function is called
;; before early-next-pos and after continue-with-pos?).
;; 
;; init-pos : P (I think? might be Q? seems like P is the only sensible choice)
;;
;; P -> continue-with-pos?
;; P -> pos->element (only if continue-with-pos? is true)
;; P -> early-next-pos -> Q
;; Q -> continue-after-pos+val?
;; Q -> next-pos -> P (only if continue-after-pos+val? is true)
;;
;; The continue-after-val? function is not relevant to in-transduced because the
;; current transduction state and the upstream sequence are the only things that
;; determine when the sequence ends, not the emitted values.
;;
;; Implementation Approach
;;
;; Positions are instances of transducer-position, which contains the current
;; transduction state, the most recent upstream sequence element (which is an
;; (or/c list? #f) value), and a thunk to generate rest of elements. The latter
;; two values are obtained from the sequence-generate* function. Whether the
;; position is a P-type position or a Q-type position affects whether the
;; position's transduction state is allowed to be a #:consume state. Q allows
;; #:consume, P does not.
;;
;; Valid P states: #:emit, #:half-closed-emit, #:finish
;; Valid Q states: #:emit, #:half-closed-emit, #:finish, #:consume
;;
;; Whenever a P is needed, as long as the current state is #:consume, upstream
;; sequence elements must be iterated. This occurs when producing the init-pos
;; and just after calling next-pos. These are the only points where upstream
;; sequence elements should be consumed. If the upstream sequence is exhausted,
;; then the transducer's half-closer function should be called on the #:consume
;; state in order to produce the next state. This transformation is performed by
;; the advance-transducer-position function.
;;
;; The returned sequence should produce one element each time the state is an
;; #:emit or #:half-closed-emit state. Once the state is #:finish, no more
;; elements should be produced and the transducer's finisher function should be
;; called on the final state. The sequence protocol uses the continue-with-pos?
;; and continue-after-pos+val? functions to stop iteration, but does not specify
;; any function to be called after iteration ends to clean things up. So, this
;; implementation will call the transducer's finisher function within the
;; continue-with-pos? and continue-after-pos+val? functions, just before they
;; return true.
