@title{Transducers}
@defmodule[rebellion/streaming/transducer]

A @deftech{transducer} is an object that can incrementally transform one
(potentially infinite) sequence of elements into another sequence. Transducers
are state machines; performing a transduction involves @emph{starting} the
transducer to get an initial state, then repeatedly updating that state by
either @emph{consuming} an element from the input sequence or by @emph{emitting}
an element to the output sequence. When the input sequence is exhausted, the
transducer enters a @emph{half closed} state where it may emit more output
elements but it will never consume more input elements. When the transducer
stops emitting elements, its @emph{finisher} is called to clean up any resources
held in the final transduction state. Optionally, a transducer may half close
early, before the input sequence is fully consumed.

@defproc[(transducer? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
 A predicate for @tech{transducers}.}

@defproc[(transduce [seq sequence?]
                    [trans transducer?] ...
                    [#:into red reducer?])
         any/c]{
 Executes a @deftech{transduction pipeline}, alternatively called a
 @deftech{stream pipeline}, which transforms the source @racket[seq] with a
 series of intermediate operations --- represented by the @racket[trans]
 arguments --- then reduces the transformed sequence with @racket[red].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 20)
              (filtering even?)
              (mapping number->immutable-string)
              #:into (join-into-string ", ")))}

@defproc[(in-transducing [seq sequence?] [trans transducer?]) sequence?]{
 Lazily transduces @racket[seq] with @racket[trans], returning a @tech{sequence}
 that, when iterated, passes the elements of @racket[seq] to @racket[trans] as
 inputs and uses the emitted outputs of @racket[trans] as the wrapper sequence's
 elements.}

@defproc[(filtering [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that passes input elements downstream only when
 they satisfy @racket[pred].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (filtering even?)
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(mapping [f (-> any/c any/c)]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that applies @racket[f] to input elements and
 emits the returned result downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (mapping (Î» (x) (* x x)))
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(append-mapping [f (-> any/c sequence?)]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that applies @racket[f] to input elements and
 emits each element in the returned sequence downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (set 'red 'green 'blue)
              (append-mapping symbol->immutable-string)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(folding [f (-> any/c any/c any/c)] [init any/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that folds over the input elements and emits the
 current fold state after each element. Specifically, the transducer starts with
 @racket[init] as its state and, for each input element, applies @racket[f] to
 its current state and the input element returning the next state, which is also
 sent downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce (in-range 1 10)
              (folding + 0)
              #:into into-list))}

@defproc[(taking [amount natural?]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that limits the upstream sequence to its first
 @racket[amount] elements. There is no buffering; each element is consumed and
 emitted downstream before the next one is consumed.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world"
              (taking 5)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(taking-while [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that terminates the upstream sequence as soon as
 @racket[pred] returns false for an element. Each element for which @racket[
 pred] returns true is passed downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "The quick brown fox"
              (taking-while char-alphabetic?)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(dropping [amount natural?]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes the first @racket[amount] elements
 from the transduced sequence, then passes all remaining elements downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "hello world"
              (dropping 5)
              #:into into-string))}

@defproc[(dropping-while [pred predicate/c]) transducer?]{
 Constructs a @tech{transducer} that removes elements from the transduced
 sequence until @racket[pred] returns false for an element, then passes all
 remaining elements downstream.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (transduce "The quick brown fox"
              (dropping-while char-alphabetic?)
              #:into into-string))}
