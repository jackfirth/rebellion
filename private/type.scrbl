@title[#:style (list 'toc)]{Data Types}
@defmodule[rebellion/type]

A @deftech{data type} or simply @deftech{type} is a set of values together with
1) some basic operations on those values and 2) a predicate to test whether a
value is within that set. There are many different kinds of data types, with
different basic operations and meant for different use cases.

@section{Interfaces Common to All Types}

The @racketmodname[rebellion/type] module is broken down into a collection of
modules, such as @racketmodname[rebellion/type/record] and @racketmodname[
 rebellion/type/tuple]. Each module is meant for working with a specific kind of
data type. However, all of these modules have a few things in common.

@subsection{Nominal v.s. Structural Types}

Any type created in @racketmodname[rebellion/type] is a @deftech{nominal type},
not a @deftech{structural type}. This means creating a new type, such as with
@racket[define-record-type], creates a new named unique type that is distinct
from all other types. The functions created by one use of @racket[
 define-record-type] will not work on instances created via another use of
@racket[define-record-type], even if both types are named the same and have
exactly the same fields.

@subsection{Struct-Based Types and Struct Type Properties}

All types are created using Racket @tech{structs}, and the created struct types
can have @tech{structure type properties} attached to them. Each module
typically provides default structure type properties for the types it creates,
based on how its types are typically used. These defaults can be freely
overriden when desired.

@subsection{Type Implementations and Generativity}

The structure, or @deftech{shape} of a type is distinct from an @deftech{
 implementation} of that type. Each @racketmodname[rebellion/type] module
reflects this distinction by providing two different interfaces for shapes and
implementations. A @racketmodname[rebellion/type] module for working with @var[
 kind] types provides:

@itemlist[
 @item{A @racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-type?} type which describes the shape of a
  @racket[_kind] type but does not provide any constructors, accessors, or
  predicates. Two @racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-type?} values are equal whenever
  the names, field counts, etc. of the types they describe are equivalent. That
  is, @racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-type?} values are compared using structural
  equality. The term @deftech{shape of a type} or simply @tech{shape}, refers
  to a @racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-type?} value. When used without any
  qualification, the term @tech{type} typically refers to such a value as
  well.}

 @item{A @racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-descriptor?} type which provides an actual
  implementation of a @racket[_kind] type, including a predicate and any
  relevant constructors and accessors. Such an implementation is called a
  @deftech{type descriptor}, and allows generically operating on unknown types
  at runtime. At runtime, the term @deftech{implementation of a type}, or
  simply @tech{implementation}, refers to a type descriptor.}]

A @racket[_kind] descriptor can be created for a type using the
@racketidfont{make-}@racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-implementation} function
provided by the corresponding @racketmodfont{rebellion/type/}@racket[_kind]
module. Multiple calls to such a function with the same type will produce
distinct implementations that are not @racket[equal?] to each other, meaning
that the @racketmodname[rebellion/type] modules create @deftech{generative
 types}.

@subsection{Defining Types}

Each @racketmodfont{rebellion/type/}@racket[_kind] module provides a
@racketidfont{define-}@racket[_kind]@racketidfont{-type} form that creates a new
type and binds its constructor, predicate, and accessors to variables. These
forms are how most users of the @racketmodname[rebellion/type] modules are
expected to create types, similar to how most Racket struct types are created
with the @racket[struct] form rather than the dynamic @racket[make-struct-type]
function.

@subsection{Compile-Time Type Information}

At present, no means of representing compile-time information about types is
provided. As a result various related features, such as integration with
@racket[match] are not provided by any @racketmodname[rebellion/type] modules.
However, both a basic represention of compile-time type information and
integration with @racket[match] are intended to happen eventually. More advanced
functionality such as a full static type system and compile-time type checker 
are out of scope for now, but it is hoped that such an effort can either build
on or integrate with this library.
